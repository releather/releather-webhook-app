Thank you for your interest in ReLeather.

Based on your photos and the information provided, this type of leather has a surface-level color coating rather than being dyed through. Our color restoration process is limited to reapplying color as it was originally manufactured. While the treatment is surface-level, we apply a thorough foundation layer to improve durability. The leather will still wear according to the natural characteristics of this material. As a result, we cannot offer our service guarantee for this type of leather.

As an alternative, we can offer Leather Reupholstery. Our Full Leather Upholstery service replacing all upholstery with new leather of your choice. We offer a wide selection of colors, textures, and finishes. If only certain cushions or sections are being replaced, our Partial Leather Upholstery service recovers damaged leather with closely matching leather. This requires purchasing new leather and disassembly of the upholstery.

Please contact if you would like to move forward with an appointment. Thank you."""
